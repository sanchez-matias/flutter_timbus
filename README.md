# Timbus Annotations

This is a score annotation app for typical gambling games from South America, mostly played in Uruguay and Argentina.

There is also a _Rules_ section where you can consult how to play every game.

The app will store any pending match locally so the player doesn't loose the match data on finishing the app.
